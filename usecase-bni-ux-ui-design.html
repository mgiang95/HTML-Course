          <p>
            As part of a cross-functional team that included business analysts,
            product owners, developers, and designers, I contributed in
            redesigning core features and establishing UX patterns for the new
            version of WinCredit. My responsibilities spanned from the initial
            setup of the design system to working as a product designer in an
            agile environment. Together with the team, we defined requirements
            and mapped user flows through. I created high-fidelity screens that
            visualized new concepts, helping us gather feedback and align on the
            development process.

          <p>
            The main task was to redesign the core features from the
            predecessor. These features were unrestrictive, allowing users to
            add or remove information freely, often without understanding the
            consequences. Additionally, the B2B software was had extensive
            client-side customization, as businesses had different processes on
            the same topic. This flexibility, while valuable, led to
            inconsistencies and confusion among users and stakeholders to
            maintain the software.

          <p>
            The flexibility of the legacy software often led to errors and
            required very specific inputs. Our goal was therefore to create
            guiding workflows without compromising flexibility.

          <br />
          <p>
            We redesigned input methods based on data gathered from WinCredit 2
            to guide users through a modal based editing mode. This allowed us
            to cater to different business processes while maintaining
            consistency across the platform. By implementing this way of
            guidance, we also ensured that users were aware of the impact of
            their actions. This redesign not only simplified the core
            functionality, but also maintained the customizability required for
            different clients such as the complexity of a notepad field.

          <p>
            Another main task involved the development of a dashboard.
            Initially, the requirements contained a wide range of features that,
            from a UX perspective, cluttered the work flow.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Dashboards are often promoted as essential tools to clients, but

              >Taras Bakusevych</a
            >, the development should be done later in the process to avoid
            feature bloat. However, from a business perspective, they are often
            highly sellable.
          </p>

            Within this context, we challenged the value of the dashboard.

          <p>
            One feature involved the use case of extending the conditions of a
            credit contract. These cases had numerous dependencies, and in most
            instances, the data couldn’t be mutated during the fixed term. My
            role in this process was to map out all conditions involved,
            providing an overview across multiple systems and applications.

            This journey includes several business applications, required data
            from different databases, and involved various user roles (such as
            final verification). I collaborated with business analysts to create
            a visual map that compressed the entire workflow into a coherent
            structure. It questioned several processes, dialogues and inputs
            that were initially thoughtful but turned out to be uneccessary
            complex. Additionally, it acted as a foundation for refining
            workflows and ensuring alignment across the project, improving the
            overall efficiency of the process.

          <br />
          <p>
            I worked closely with the development team to ensure that design
            concepts were technically feasible. The front-end architecture was
            based on Angular. An example of this collaboration occurred during
            the dashboard development, where issues arrose with synching data
            automatically from multiple databases. From a UX perspective, we
            offered solutions focusing on transparency. We introduced concepts
            of progress feedback (such as a “last updated” timestamp), or a
            manual refresh option with status indicators to give users control
            within the technical constraints.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These challenges were addressed through open communication with the
            development team, ensuring both the technical and usability aspects
            were optimized.

          <h2>Challenges faced</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The main challenge we faced was gaining traction in a newly
            established, multidisciplinary team. As a UX team, we suggested
            improvements to ensure alignment with development goals such as
            reviewing HTML/CSS code architecture to ensure the maintenance of
            the components.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Another challenge was that some initial features were conceptualized
            without fully considering the technical limitations, which were
            tangible during the design phase. To address this, we established
            early feedback loops with the development team to discuss technical
            feasibility early in the process. This proactive approach helped
            prevent issues and reduced friction as the project progressed.

          <p>
            In the end, our team successfully streamlined the collaboration
            process, improving it with each sprint. By involving the development
            team early on, we reduced the amount of design iterations needed
            throughout the project. Solutions were conceptualized in close
            collaboration with all stakeholders to ensure a balance between
            functionality, flexibility and usability. Our redesigns of the
            dashboard and core features adhered to the principle of UI density,
            guiding users through the workflow with clear interaction patterns,
            error prevention integrated into the process and less visual
            clutter.

            My takeaway from this project reinforced the importance of
            pragmatism in UX design, balancing ideal design solutions with
            real-world constraints like technology, user needs, and business
            goals. The success of our work wasn’t just about making the software
            visually appealing. It was about making it usable, scalable, and
            adaptable for future growth. Through close collaboration,
            user-centric design, and technical feasibility, we delivered a
            product that was both functional and future-proof.
