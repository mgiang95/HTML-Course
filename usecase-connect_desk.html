          <p>
            Linde Material Handling GmbH, a leading industrial truck
            manufacturer, offers <em>connect:desk</em> as complementing software
            tool. It provides overview in managing and analyzing data from
            connected industrial trucks. This enables features like accident
            detection, usage data and further detailed reports on vehicle
            performance.

            I worked alongside a multidisciplinary team (with 4 designers, 5
            developers, a product owner and a technical translator) to enhance
            the software‚Äôs usability and functionality, contributing to new
            feature development and a UI facelift while maintaining the
            component library.

          <h2>Problem statement and contribution</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Initially intended as an integrated system with a specific, limited
            use case in mind, connect:desk experienced feature bloat over time.
            New features and reports were necessary due to emerging technologies
            such as electric engines or fuel cell forklifts. However, customers
            spanned across small warehouses to large intenrational organisations
            had different requirements. Therefore a rigid software lead to a
            cluttered UI with unnecessary complexity and performance issues.

      <section class="case-section">
        <div class="case-text">
          <h2>Modularizing the software</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            As the software evolved, modularization became a key feature,
            enabling users to pick specific functions based on their individual
            needs. This approach improved usability by reducing UI clutter and
            tailoring the platform to client-specific requirements.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Implementing modularization required careful planning to map out
            cross-dependencies, ensuring that changes in one module did not
            negatively affect others. Users could manage these modules through
            their account settings, but since this was also a process with
            sensitive dependencies, access was restricted by an additional
            permission system to prevent unauthorized adjustments.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The development of this approach also involved close collaboration
            with the development team. It was crucial to update the component
            library regularly and maintain system stability across the platform,
            ensuring that new or modified features integrated seamlessly with
            existing ones.

      <!-- Zone Control -->

        <div class="case-text">
          <h2>Introducing zone control</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            A huge addition to the software was the introduction of the zone
            control feature. Physical transmitters are placed in the warehouse
            allowing users to define specific geo-fences where automatic rules
            like speed regulations could be applied to vehicles.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This feature required new UI elements, such as draggable radii for
            adjusting zone sizes and map navigation tools. After several
            briefings with the engineering team, we designed these elements,
            drawing inspiration from map tools like OpenStreetMap and canvas
            based tools like Illustrator and Sketch. We created a concept where
            users could place anchors on the UI, represneting the transmitters
            in the warehouse. These anchors can be grouped to apply rules such
            as speed limits or lift height restrictions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Challenges arose due to different input methods and workflow
            integration. The internal engineering tool allowed quick, flexible
            changes. In contrast, connect:desk required a more rigid approach,
            with inputs validated in an editing mask before saving. It is
            necessary to consider, that setting up anchors in the warehouse and
            mapping them in the UI is sensitve work, typically done by service
            technicians. Also, rules mostly stay unchanged, thus an additional
            control layer to prevent modifications by accident. Our focus with
            this concept was on balancing flexibility with reliability, making
            sure the UI was both intuitive and secure for various user needs.

          <h2>Modernizing UI and component library</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            As part of the connect:desk redesign, our team focused on
            modernizing the UI, originally released in 2012 where skeuomorphism
            was still broadly represented. With stacking features and newly
            introduced UI elements, we faced pefrormance issues, especially for
            clients managing larger fleets. To tackle this, we streamlined our
            component library, collaborating closely with the development team
            to ensure all updates aligned with evolving design requirements.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We explored several design variants, from minimal tweaks to more
            radical facelifts. Ultimately, we chose a minimal approach,
            retaining the exsiting information architecture and focusing on
            interchangeable icons and subtle color adjustments, especially given
            the constraints of JavaFX. Key UI elements like buttons, input
            fields, and the app frame were updated, leading to better
            performance, particularly through modularization.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Removing skeuomorphism and transitioning to a cleaner, more modern
            design required us to adjust the component library which followed

            conventions, which were resolved through close collaboration with
            developers, aligning mental models and ensuring consistency in the
            final components. Clear communication with the development team
            ensured smooth implementation throughout the process.

            Initially designed as a integrated system, connect:desk faced
            feature bloat over time. Emerging technologies demanded new features
            and reports. However, its diverse customer base had varying needs.
            This led to a rigid, cluttered UI with unnecessary complexity and
            performance issues. My contributions to this project led to the
