            The aim of this project was to design a borrowing and renting app
            concept and build a component library from scratch. I envisioned a
            platform where users could host cooking sessions, splitting the cost
            of ingredients to fight food waste. This concept, named ‚ÄúCookflow‚Äù,
            went beyond than just feeding people‚Äîit also introduced them to new
            recipes and cooking techniques.

            During the stage of low-fidelity prototyping, I decided to create a
            component library using Adobe XD‚Äôs linked file system. This approach
            allowed for quick updates to core UI elements across different
            screens and design files. The atomic design methodology from
            <a
              class="link-text-inline"
              href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/"

            >
            was applied, which helped break down the UI into small, reusable
            components and assets, ensuring consistency across the design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Building a modular system is time-saving when there is a plenty
            amount of repetitive elements and screens involved. However,
            depending on the fidelity it also brought challenges, especially in
            the beginning when the speed of developing variations was affected.

          <h2>Transition to high-fidelity wireframes</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            With the basic structure in place, I moved to high-fidelity
            wireframes, refining visual elements like font sizes, color schemes,
            and hierarchy. Using nested components ensured consistent assets
            across screens to systematize properties like padding and margins.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While nested components streamlined iterations, they introduced
            complexity and performance issues, slowing the design process due to
            increased file size and layer count. The layered structure of these
            components ultimately slowed down the design process, revealing the
            trade-off between flexibility and efficiency.

            In refining the design language, I was confronted with conflicts in
            the visual hierarchy, e.g. in determining suitable font sizes and
            creating a uniform color harmony. Early on, I had not fully
            considered how various elements, such as list items, cards, and
            overlays, would interact visually. This resulted in misaligned
            visual hierarchies, requiring further iteration to balance the
            design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To address this, I drew inspiration from
            <a
              class="link-text-inline"
              href="https://m2.material.io/design/environment/elevation.html#elevation-in-material-design"
              >Google Material Design</a
            >, creating a system that used z-index elevation levels paired with
            a fine-tuned color gradient to better reflect layer hierarchy.

            Additionally, technical challenges arose due to Adobe XD‚Äôs
            performance, especially when dealing with a large number of
            artboards, links, auto-animate functions, and layer count (as
            mentioned before). Crashes and lost interaction links were frequent,
            slowing down the prototyping process.

            This project taught me valuable lessons about the importance of
            structured design processes. Setting up a design system from
            scratch, while time-consuming, proved to be extremely beneficial
            during later stages of the project. Despite technical challenges
            with Adobe XD, the modular system I created allowed retrospectively
            for flexibility and scalability, laying the methodical groundwork
            for future design projects.

            Coming from a background in Photoshop for UI design (yes that was a
            thing if you design for fixed hardware display layouts), this
            required a shift in my design approach.

                Learning how to efficiently componentize elements was a steep
                learning curve. Especially as I transitioned from low-fidelity
                to high-fidelity screens. Establishing a component library
                allowed for quick changes across the screens. However, it became
                clear that an atomic design approach could have been implemented
                later in the process to avoid early complexity and to gain
                velocity (or at least the fidelity of the design components
                could‚Äôve been reduced).

                foundation for font sizes and color schemes earlier in the
