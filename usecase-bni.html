          <p>
            BaseNet Informatik offers B2B finance software for the entire credit
            life cycle. <em>WinCredit 3</em> provides overview for credit
            initiation as well as administration and the associated securities
            for private individuals or legal entities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The project was initiated with a technical proof of concept for
            <em>WinCredit 3</em> and will be continued with more features over
            the next years. From a UX lens, the main goal was to support user
            workflows by reducing unnecessary sources of error and to refresh
            the user interface to modern usability standards.

            The project involved migrating the component library from Adobe XD
            to Figma, creating a scalable and efficient design system used
            across multiple products. This transition improved collaboration and
            highlighted the need for ongoing design system management despite
            challenges with balancing maintenance and deliverable deadlines.

          <br />
          <p>
            I worked with a cross-functional team to redesign core features and
            establish UX patterns for the new version of WinCredit. My
            responsibilities included creating high-fidelity screens, mapping
            user journeys, and collaborating with developers to ensure
            feasibility.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The main challenge was balancing flexibility with consistency, which
            we addressed through guided workflows and feedback loops. The
            outcome was a streamlined, user-centered design that improved both
            functionality and adaptability for future growth.

          <p>
            Migrating to Figma was essential for future-proofing the design
            system, though it underscored the need for a dedicated role to
            maintain component libraries. The project highlighted the importance
            of balancing library upkeep with tight deadlines, emphasizing that a
            design system is a living document. My key takeaway was the need for
            pragmatism in UX design, balancing ideal solutions with real-world
            constraints to create a scalable and adaptable product.

            I want to thank Rafael Adame for the opportunity to work on this
            project, where I could leverage my skills and make valuable
            contributions. His high-level UX design approach was impressive and
            something I aim to apply in future projects.

          <p>
            I also want to thank Sonja Frey for her valuable feedback and
            contributions to the design system. Her insights and critique
            sessions were essential for both the design system and my personal
            development.

            Lastly, I appreciate the product team Tenemit especially Damian
            Hofmann for their technical explanations and expertise, which helped
            me better understand the context and translate it into thoughtful
            designs.
