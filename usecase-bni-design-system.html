          <p>
            As part of the <em>WinCredit 3</em> project, our design team
            migrated the component library from Adobe XD to Figma. The goal was
            to establish a scalable and efficient design system that could
            support not only <em>WinCredit 3</em> but also other company
            products. This system became a central source of truth, accessible
            to designers and stakeholders for assets, patterns and code
            components.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There was central design language, but individual child themes were
            derived depending on the project. These individual themes mostly
            affected color, fonts, spacing, assets or border radiuses. Since
            every product had Bootstrap 5 as foundational framework, this would
            also streamline processes within the design team.

          <h2>Problem statement</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Before the project began, Adobe XD was the main tool to design
            components, but it had become outdated in recent years. Tasks like
            creating high-fidelity screens became increasingly tedious as
            projects grew in complexity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The other two designers had primarily been focused on
            cross-functional work and developing new features, which left less
            time for maintaining the components. This contributed to some
            inconsistencies across the designs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Although an initial cost-benefit analysis suggested that migrating
            to Figma might not be essential, growing design requirements, new
            functionality, and the launch of WinCredit 3 made the transition
            viable.

            To maintain design integrity, I conducted a visual audit of the
            existing assets and components to gain an understanding of the
            environment. I began by taking inventory of the actual
            implementation and compared it with the design components, reviewing
            styles to identify inconsistencies and outdated classes. Next, I
            focused on the visual qualities of the elements, such as color,
            typography, and spacing. This involved looking for inconsistencies
            and making necessary adjustments to bring them up to standard.

          <h2>Component library migration</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            I was responsible for transitioning the entire component library
            from Adobe XD to Figma. For the process I drew inspiration from
            articles by
            <a

              target="_blank"

          <br />
          <p>
            This process involved rebuilding each component from scratch to
            ensure consistency and precision. I established patterns for layer
            naming conventions and usage guides to improve clarity. In addition,
            I set conventions to leverage advanced design components such as
            swap properties and starter-kits to streamline the workflow.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During the transition, I encountered initial performance issues with
            stakeholders, particularly related to layer count and file size,
            which I addressed by optimizing the components for example by
            reducing hidden layers and separating loaded design files in feature
            epics.

            In the trajectory of the project, standards for design components
            and interaction patterns were defined in a library in collaboration
            with the design team. It follows

            while reflecting the documentation structure of Bootstrap 5, which
            is the visual code base of the product family. Instead of atoms,
            molecules and organisms, we categorized out files to such as
            components, layout, forms and content. This step helped to ensure
            that all designers and developers were able to navigate across four
            different projects.

          <p>
            As part of my responsibility, I continuously improved the components
            based on feedback from the design team. For example, I introduced
            the switch from base components to the use of swap component
            properties in the component library to facilitate maintainability.
            This approach ensured that the components not only met the current
            project requirements, but were modular to implement in future
            applications.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With new component iterations, I introduced a process to indicate
            and archive deprecated components (inspired by the

              >Verizon product team</a

            workflow by introducing starter kits for more complex components,
            such as accordions, modals or tables. These starter kits became
            important tools for other designers, allowing them to quickly
            implement standard components without having to start from scratch.

            design team and scrum team. These sessions ensured that everyone
            involved could get familiar with Figma and navigate through new
            design system in their respective roles. It also involved weekly
            open hours to improve component composition and monthly session to

          <p>
            The main challenge was to create an appropriate shared resource and
            understanding for all stakeholders, while ensuring that this design
            system was ready for production. Whilst I had experience of setting
            up Figma components from previous projects, in most cases the system
            was set up for other designers. Therefore, this project required
            attention to detail as well as collaboration between the different
            disciplines and the pace to finish deliverables.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Another challenge during the design was the performance and file
            size of the components within Figma. While in the project, we had
            issues with loading times as all the designs were located in a few
            files. Splitting the files into several was one option, but to find
            a sustainable solution I also had to rework the component files to
            reduce complexity and layer count.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Looking back, the decision to migrate to Figma was a crucial step in
            future-proofing the design system, both for this and future
            projects. In an earlier design job in 2021, I had suggested the
            creation of a dedicated “librarian” role to manage component
            libraries. However, this idea was not implemented at the time due to
            cost-benefit concerns.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This project highlighted the significance of that role even more, as
            maintaining a healthy design system requires ongoing attention.
            Nevertheless, it was a balancing between the maintenance of the
            library and the primary goal of meeting deliverable deadlines. When
            feature releases became more urgent, it was tangible that the
            library was getting dusted, highlighting that it is a living
            document after all.
